# Text-Based-MP3-Player

This program is a virtual MP3 player that allows the user to "play" (output lyrics to the console) different tracks as desired, along with other options such as searching for specific tracks, creating playlists, and displaying all tracks. The result is a text-based UI for an MP3 player, without the actual audio of the song itself or the lyrics to actual songs - that would be copyrighted material. However, the functionality remains the same. 

# What Techniques Were Incorporated

This program incorporated classes  (both private and public), pass-by-value and pass-by-reference functions, vectors, and gathering input from other local files. 

# How It Works

Upon executing this program, the user will be presented with a list of options (1 through 5) that present different options for viewing or managing their local tracks. There is a fixed number of tracks that the user can select from, but the main focus of this project was to show basic management of input from multiple files using classes and vectors in C++.


# Execution

To run the following program, clone the repository to your computer and then compile it. This project was written in C++ and was tested on Windows using MSYS2 (MinGW64).

### Requirements
- g++ (C++17)

### Compile
g++ lab11.cpp -o program

### Run
./program


Since the main program is a C++ file (named lab11.cpp), use g++ to execute it, and remember the names of the other MP3 files (should be Track1, Track2, Track3 etc.) so that they can be added via option 1 in the console terminal.

# Purpose

The purpose of this program was to demonstrate knowledge of advanced final content of first-semester course material - classes and vectors - as well as to incorporate text input from other files to show a wide breadth of knowledge regarding this programming language.
