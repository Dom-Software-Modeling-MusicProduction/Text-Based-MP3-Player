Lines on a Screen
Back Light Havens
Roomy Nonsense
2002

Verse 1
The room is quiet, the clock moves slow,
Another minute starts to go.
A list of songs, a name, a time,
A cursor waits, a steady line.

Nothing special, nothing loud,
Just simple words that say it out loud.
A verse begins, a verse will end,
Text appears and then descends.

Pre-Chorus
Scrolling up, then scrolling down,
Every line is safely found.
Stored in files, read with care,
Printed cleanly, always there.

Chorus
These are lines upon a screen,
Not a story, not a dream.
Just enough to play the part,
Data flowing from the start.
Press a key, the music stays,
Moving forward, line by line,
Nothing lost and nothing strange,
Just text and time.

Verse 2
A title loads, an artist name,
Every track behaves the same.
Open file, begin to read,
One more line at user speed.

Pause the song, resume again,
Reach the end, return to ten.
No surprises, no disguise,
Just ordered words in simple ties.

Pre-Chorus
Characters in careful rows,
Each one placed where logic goes.
Memory holds, then lets it pass,
One more song, the next one lasts.

Chorus
These are lines upon a screen,
Clear and plain and in between.
Nothing hidden, nothing rare,
Just structured text handled with care.
Forward, backward, stop and play,
Every choice goes the right way,
A working system, clean and true,
That’s all it needs to do.

Bridge
If this ends, another starts,
Same old words in different parts.
Change the file, the flow remains,
Only data ever changes.

No real voice, no borrowed sound,
Just original text all around.
Built to test, to load, to show,
Exactly how the program goes.

Final Chorus
These are lines upon a screen,
Simple, steady, routine.
They exist to demonstrate
How the parts communicate.
End of track, return to start,
Every piece plays its part,
No applause, no curtain call,
Just working code — that’s all.

Outro
The screen goes still, the program waits,
Until the user navigates.
Another song, another run,
Same clear logic, neatly done.
