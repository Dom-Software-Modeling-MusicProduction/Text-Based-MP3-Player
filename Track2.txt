Queue After Queue
Indie Waters
In The Midst of Classes
1976

Verse 1
A window opens, text appears,
Another track, another year.
Names align in simple rows,
Chosen paths the program knows.

Nothing rushes, nothing bends,
Each command runs to its end.
One input waits, another shows,
A steady pace, a steady flow.

Pre-Chorus
Load the file, begin the read,
Every line at user speed.
Stored in order, clear and clean,
Exactly where it’s meant to be.

Chorus
Queue after queue, song by song,
Moving calmly all along.
Start and stop, then play once more,
Same result as before.
No confusion, no delay,
Every choice goes the right way.
One more track comes into view,
Queue after queue.

Verse 2
A title fades, another stays,
Count the seconds, count the plays.
Forward skips, backward too,
Every option passes through.

Nothing breaks and nothing hides,
Logic works on every side.
From beginning to the end,
The pattern holds, again, again.

Pre-Chorus
Lines are read and lines are shown,
Only text the program owns.
Every word is placed with care,
Nothing borrowed anywhere.

Chorus
Queue after queue, line by line,
Time moves forward, text aligns.
Pause the track, then let it run,
Until the playback’s done.
Simple rules, consistent view,
That’s the job it’s meant to do.
One more choice, one more cue,
Queue after queue.

Bridge
If the list is long or small,
The process doesn’t change at all.
Swap the file, the flow remains,
Only content ever changes.

Keys are pressed, states update,
Every move accounted straight.
No surprise and no disguise,
Just clear output before your eyes.

Final Chorus
Queue after queue, start to end,
Every track a simple friend.
Not a story, not a show,
Just a system doing what it knows.
When it’s finished, wait for you,
Until the next command comes through.
Same design, steady view,
Queue after queue.

Outro
The screen goes quiet, still and clear,
Until the user reappears.
Another song, another pass,
Clean results that always last.
