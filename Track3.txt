Verse 1
The screen lights up, a moment still,
A list awaits a chosen fill.
Names and numbers, clear and plain,
Every part remains the same.

A single press, a simple start,
The system moves from where you are.
Nothing hidden, nothing loud,
Just steady text that’s shown aloud.

Pre-Chorus
Read a line, then read the next,
Order holds the printed text.
Memory keeps what it must find,
Then lets it go, right on time.

Chorus
Static and time, moving slow,
One more line begins to show.
Forward motion, clean design,
Every step stays in line.
Stop and wait, or start again,
Same result from end to end.
No confusion, no surprise,
Just static and time.

Verse 2
A title ends, another plays,
Measured seconds pass in waves.
Pause between, then carry through,
Every state returns to true.

Keys respond, the screen updates,
Every choice recalculates.
From the first line to the last,
Nothing breaks and nothing’s cast.

Pre-Chorus
Files are opened, closed, and read,
Only text the program said.
Every word belongs right here,
Nothing borrowed, nothing unclear.

Chorus
Static and time, frame by frame,
Every track behaves the same.
Up or down, begin or end,
All commands correctly send.
Press a key, the system tries,
Then returns in quiet lines.
Just static and time.

Bridge
Change the order, change the name,
The logic never shifts its frame.
Different words, identical flow,
That’s the part the user knows.

No performance, no display,
Just behavior on its way.
Every rule remains intact,
Simple cause, expected act.

Final Chorus
Static and time, start to close,
Every moment calmly goes.
From the queue back to the start,
Each command plays its part.
When the screen returns to still,
The program waits until you will.
Static and time align,
Every run, every time.

Outro
The cursor rests, the screen is clear,
Until the user’s next idea appears.
