End of the List

Stronger in the Sunrise
1879

Verse 1
The program starts, the screen is clear,
A numbered list appears right here.
Titles load in ordered space,
Each one waiting in its place.

No rush forward, no rewind,
Just simple steps in steady time.
One selection, one response,
Everything behaves as planned.

Pre-Chorus
Open file and read it through,
Every line returns on cue.
Stored, displayed, then passed along,
Only text that does belong.

Chorus
This is the end of the list for now,
Every track has shown somehow.
Start again or choose a new,
Every option leads you through.
Nothing hidden, nothing missed,
This is the end of the list.

Verse 2
A counter moves from start to end,
Then resets and starts again.
Pause between, then let it play,
Same result in either way.

Keys respond without delay,
Every state updates cleanly.
From first input to final line,
All the logic stays aligned.

Pre-Chorus
Nothing changes under strain,
Different words, the same domain.
Swap the data, keep the frame,
Only surface text is changed.

Chorus
This is the end of the list once more,
Every track has played before.
Scroll back up or close the view,
The system waits on you.
Clear output, simple gist,
This is the end of the list.

Bridge
If more songs are added in,
The process starts again within.
Same design and same routine,
Only length shifts in between.

No performance, no disguise,
Just behavior you can verify.
Built to work, not to impress,
Clean results, nothing less.

Final Chorus
This is the end of the list tonight,
Every item ran just right.
When it stops, the screen stays still,
Waiting for the user’s will.
Another run or exit twist,
That’s the end of the list.

Outro
The cursor rests, the program stays,
Ready for another play.
