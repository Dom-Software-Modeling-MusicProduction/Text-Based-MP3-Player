Playback State
CaliforniaDreaminSkies
Where are you now?
1934

Verse 1
A list is loaded, one by one,
Waiting here until it’s done.
Titles sit in quiet rows,
Chosen paths the program knows.

No background, no spoken sound,
Just written lines that run around.
A simple start, a steady pace,
Each step stays in its place.

Pre-Chorus
Read the file, return the line,
Keep the order, keep the time.
Every value stored and shown,
Only text the system owns.

Chorus
Playback state, clear and true,
Every action follows through.
Start and stop, then play again,
Same result from start to end.
Nothing fades and nothing waits,
Just a change in playback state.

Verse 2
Seconds pass but nothing drifts,
Only counters rise and shift.
Pause the track, then let it run,
Resume right where it was begun.

Forward skips and backward too,
All commands are seen right through.
Every branch returns a sign,
Every output stays in line.

Pre-Chorus
Characters in measured form,
Handled cleanly, safely stored.
No surprise and no delay,
Every step goes the right way.

Chorus
Playback state, line by line,
Each command resets the time.
From the queue back to the start,
Every piece plays its part.
Press a key, the value updates,
That’s the change in playback state.

Bridge
If the song is long or short,
Logic still provides support.
Swap the text, the flow remains,
Only surface detail changes.

Nothing hidden, nothing claimed,
Only original text by name.
Built to show and built to test,
Function over all the rest.

Final Chorus
Playback state, end to start,
Every run reflects the chart.
Clear design and simple flow,
That’s the only thing to know.
When it stops, the screen stays still,
Until the user bends the will.
Playback state, consistent, straight,
Working code — that’s its fate.

Outro
The program waits, the cursor stays,
Ready for another play.
